  o Minor bugfix (pluggable transports):
    - When Tor is about to advertize "0.0.0.0" in its extrainfo descriptor, it
      replaces the bogus address 0.0.0.0 with its external address.  This patch
      uses tor_addr_is_internal() instead of tor_addr_is_null(), so internal
      addresses like 10.0.0.0/8 are also replaced. Fixes bug 31009; bugfix on
      0.4.3.0-alpha.
